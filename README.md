# Socialgram
A simple social network that i made for my highschool diploma at I.T.I.S A. Bernocchi in Legnano, Italy

Back in time when i made this i had basically 1 month to finish it, so i didn't really had time to plan it very well and that's why the code is a mess, but everything works fine so i'm not going to touch it, i could comment it but im too lazy to read the code, maybe someday but not today. :P
